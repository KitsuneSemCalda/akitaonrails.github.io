I am Fabio Akita, long time blogger and content creator focused on new technology, career in programming, retro-gaming and anything geek-related. More than a content creator I am a computer science graduate, and I have been working with programming since the early 1990s. I do have extensive experience in all aspects of the computing industry. That's why I write about it: because I had first hand experience.

This blog started at the old [Blogspot](https://web.archive.org/web/20060715034642/http://balanceonrails.blogspot.com/) as Balance on Rails (I worked for a small consultancy shop called Balance, back in the early 2000s). It started as a Ruby on Rails evangelist page, back when Rails was pre-1.0. I even wrote one of the first books about Rails, in Brazilian Portuguese.

I have been writing online since 2006. It's been more than a thousand posts and almost 20 years. During this period I opened my own shop called [Codeminer 42](https://codeminer42.com), in 2011. I also organized Ruby and Tech Conferences in Brazil from 2007 all the way to 2019.

Covid-19 came along, and I started a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Akitando) that surpassed 500,000 subscribers in mid-2025. It's a timeless chanell with everything a programmer needs to know to have a bubble-proof and ever lasting career in tech. I finished what I wanted to share in 2024, and I don't have any immediate plans to return. All videos are still valuable content.

I am always dabbling and ruminating about random tech topics on [X](https://x.com/AkitaOnRails) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/akitaonrails/). Both are protected and personal accounts, so you have to request permission to join. And beware that I frequently block and report spammers and haters alike. Joining is a privilege, do not waste it.

I used to travel all around the world to talk at conferences, podcasts, etc. But I am now retired from talking. If you want to see what I am doing these days, there is this blog and my X and Instagram.

I never accepted sponsorships or did any kind of paid content. And I am still not open to be paid to talk things I don't believe in. Do not test me.

If you have important matters to talk to me, you can send an email to my company's [contact email](email://contact@codeminer42.com). I won't reply unless it interests me.
