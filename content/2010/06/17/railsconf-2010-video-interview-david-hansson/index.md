One person that I didn’t have the opportunity to interview until this day was David Hansson himself. We talked briefly a few times in the past, but this was our first longer conversation.

I particularly enjoyed this interview because he was very easygoing. We discussed the Rails 3 project and what he enjoys most about it. We also talked about old stuff, such as the story of when he visited Brazil in 2005—if you didn’t know that, check it out!

Besides that, we also talked a bit about “Rework” related subjects such as people management and entrepreneurship. And I couldn’t let go of the opportunity to mention Ricardo Semler to him, of course :-)

So, a nice conversation—of around 24 minutes—with David Hansson himself is a good way to wrap up my material on RailsConf 2010. It was an excellent event with excellent people, and I hope to be able to meet you all again next year!
