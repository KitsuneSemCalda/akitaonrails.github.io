After a long gap I finally managed to contribute a bit to **RubyLearning.org**. I’ve written a 2 part article about Internationalization (i18n) in Brazilian Portuguese a few days ago. I’ve adapted it into English and you can read it at [Satish’s blog](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2012/07/24/minimal-i18n-with-rails-3-2/).

I’m showing snippets of code from a demonstration app and you can see the code at [my Github repo](https://github.com/akitaonrails/Rails-3-I18n-Demonstration) and you can also see the app up and [running here](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2012/07/24/minimal-i18n-with-rails-3-2/i18n-demo.herokuapp.com), thanks to Heroku’s free accounts.

I hope you enjoy it!
