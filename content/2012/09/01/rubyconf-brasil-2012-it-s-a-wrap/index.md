Rubyconf Brasil 2012 was a blast! 

![All the Speakers, gathered](http://s3.amazonaws.com/akitaonrails/assets/image_asset/image/21/big_546041_441163865926592_603827335_n.jpg)

I personally still pinch myself every time when I think about it, when I decided to commit to this endeavour back in 2008 neither I nor anyone would ever think that we would be able to make more than 1 Ruby Conference in Brazil. But against all odds we have been able to pull it off. 5 years have passed and every year is an improvement over the previous one. Locaweb has been a fantastic partner, and I don't think any other company in Brazil would have the same level of commitment, delivering more than expected year after year. 

This year we had an astounding **750 attendees** at Frei Caneca Convention Center and with the help of [Eventials](http://eventials.com/rubyconfbr2012) we added at least 500 more watching in real time during the 2 days of the conference. We also had the most dense Rubyconf Brasil ever with a mind boggling **31 talks**, **36 speakers** out of which **14** came from outside of Brazil.

We, of the Rubyconf Brasil staff, hope that everyone found something you really liked and that everybody had a great time. And I personally wish that if you liked it, you keep helping the Ruby community to grow larger in Latin America.
