I will depart from Brazil at 10:55PM local time and should be arriving in Las Vegas tomorrow, Sunday, around 1:15PM. I will be staying at the [Stratosphere Hotel](http://stratospherehotel.com), a little bit far from the Hilton.

I will not attend any of the tutorials on the first day. Maybe I will try to be at the Hilton, maybe I will try to be at CabooseConf. First thing I will try to do on Sunday is getting my [Macbook Pro fixed](http://gizmodo.com/5061605/apple-confirms-failing-nvidia-graphics-cards-in-macbook-pros-offers-free-repairs-and-refunds) :-) I will probably have to buy a new unit and I will spend the rest of the day restoring from my backup.

At the airport I should try to buy a pre-paid SIM card, so I can be reached more easily. But if anyone wants to get in touch with me, I think [Twitter](http://twitter.com/akitaonrails) will be the easiest way. I will be checking my e-mail constantly also.

My schedule is available at [Intridea](http://railsconf.intridea.com/) or you can directly subscribe to my [iCal calendar](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/my_ical/46ebf9ee2c82e80d8ca1217bc7f04651), so you may be able to reach me at the sessions, though it is uncertain that I will be actually following my own schedule :-) I have the tendency to hang out with people at random, so if I am not at the planned session, I am probably talking to people, making interviews, recording and so on.

My main goal with RailsConf is to talk to as many people as possible. The thing I like the most about this conference is the sheer ammount of insightful people and interesting talks.
