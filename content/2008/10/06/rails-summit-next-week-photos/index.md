[![Rails Summit Latin America](http://site.locaweb.com.br/images/locaweb/en_US/railssummit/banners/468x60.gif "Rails Summit Latin America")](http://site.locaweb.com.br/railssummit/default.asp)

All right folks, do not forget: **Rails Summit Latin America** approaches, on the 15th and 16th next week! If you still didn’t register, [click here](http://www.locaweb.com.br/railssummit-en).

Another thing: we will have a small [**Birds of a Feather**](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pU_MriAPjg2Aio1o2Qp6-Pw) session at the end of the first day. The idea is to have a few lightning talks. If you want to present anything, just [register here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pU_MriAPjg2Aio1o2Qp6-Pw). Ninh Bui, from Phusion, says he is excited to talk some more during this session :-)

We will have internet through WiFi, power plug outlets in the hall and ball rooms, so you’re welcome to get your notebooks.

And to just raise the expectations a little bit, I was able to get some 3D renderings on how the Elis Regina Auditorium will become. Check it out:
